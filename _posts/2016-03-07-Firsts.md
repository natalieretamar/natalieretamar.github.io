title: "'Firsts'"

---

 I wanted to write a FIRST blog post that would delight my readers aka cajoled friends and reflect my many interets but I realized that my 'perfect first blog post' could never exist if history is taken into account. Many of my so called 'firsts' have been epic failures, like the first time I rode a bicycle.Panic set in and I slammed the brakes so hard that I hit the ground face first and sported a nose covered in grotesque bruise color hues for the entire summer. It's pretty rare to ace something the first time around. So,for my first post I warmly say: Welcome! For the next three months, my posts will be centered around my Data Science bootcamp experience at Metis, NYC. Many 'firsts' are coming my way (python, data mining, machine learning, etc) and I am thrilled because I love learning and if you have an interest in data science or learning something completely new, share this adventure with me.
