Traversing nested Python dictionaries is tricky when LISTS are involved. Pandas create dataframes from data files so effortlessly but knowing how to wrangle the data into a dictionary and extract information from it is a fruitful exercise in understanding hierarchy, indexing and becoming familiar with a few helpful dictionary functions. 

My first attempt at creating a dictionary type of a dataframe from a .csv file didn't go as expected because I had to go back to basics and get a sense of how Python accesses information. My prior programming experience is with C++/Java and I was continually asking myself _'How is it pointing to that object/value?!'_.

Sometimes its best to start on a small scale which led me to create a Python dictionary tutorial jupyter notebook that aims to visually explain how information is stored and accessed. It is meant for beginners or anyone that has struggled with dictionaries. 

Happy coding!
