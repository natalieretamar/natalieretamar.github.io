Traversing nested Python dictionaries is tricky when LISTS are involved. Pandas create dataframes from data files so effortlessly but knowing how to create data structures with  dictionaries manipulate them is a fruitful exercise in understanding hierarchy, indexing and becoming familiar with a few helpful functions. 

My first attempt at creating a data dictionary from a .csv file didn't go as expected because I had to go back to basics and get a better understansing of how Python accesses information. My prior programming experience is with C++ and Java and I was continually asking myself _'How is it pointing to that object/value?!'_.

Sometimes its best to start on a small scale which led me to create a Python dictionary tutorial (jupyter notebook) that aims to visually explain how dictionary information is stored and retreived. It is meant for beginners or anyone that has struggled with this topic. 

Happy Coding!
