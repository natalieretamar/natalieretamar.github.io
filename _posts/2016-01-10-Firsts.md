For my first blog post I would like to warmly say: _Welcome!_      
2016 will be loaded with many 'firsts' as I embark on my **Data Science fellowship** at [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=branded&gclid=CjwKEAjw9OG4BRDJzY3jrMng4iQSJABddor1UBaqTWxa_DAou9XFoKIv1-O5PV7oXG2Y31MGjhcYwhoCRZfw_wcB), NYC. Many people have asked me _'Why data science, isn't it hard?!'_ 'Hard' is part of the lure, because I enjoy intellectually challenging myself but analyzing problems and divising creative solutions is where I thrive. For me, Data Science feels like a big next step on a familiar road. 


The subsequent posts will be chronicling the areas of technical expertise I hope to acquire in:

 * python
 * data mining
 * machine learning
 * the many other complex topics I am blissfully yet unaware of 


If you have an interest in Data Science or learning something completely new, follow my blog and share the adventure.

Happy Coding!
